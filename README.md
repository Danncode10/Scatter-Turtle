# Scatter Turtle

**Scatter Turtle** is a fun Python-based game created using Turtle Graphics. In this game, you bet on which turtle will win the race. The turtles race across the screen, and your goal is to predict the winner!

## Features
- **Turtle Race:** Watch as six colorful turtles race across the screen.
- **Betting System:** You place a bet on which turtle will win the race.
- **Random Movement:** The turtles move forward randomly at each step, making the race unpredictable.

## How to Play
1. When you run the game, you'll be prompted to bet on one of the following turtles: `purple`, `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, `orange`, or `red`.
2. After placing your bet, the turtles will race across the screen.
3. Once the race finishes, the winner is announced, and the result of your bet will be shown: either you win or lose.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- The `turtle` module (this is generally included in the standard Python library)
